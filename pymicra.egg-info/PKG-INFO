Description: # Pymicra - A Python tool for Micrometeorological Analyses
        
        This package was designed to make it easier to work with micrometeorological data. Pymicra is currently fully written in python and it's aimed towards aggregating all of functionality that is commonly needed to work with micrometeorological data into one productivity-enhancing tool.
        
        The package is extensively (almost entirely) based on Pandas, mostly the `pandas.DataFrame` class. For control of units, we use Pint and for some numerical functions not contained in Pandas, Numpy or Scipy are generally used.
        
        ## Required Packages
        Most required packages already come with python. However, packages that generally have to be manually installed beforehand are:
        
        * Pandas
        * Pint
        * Numpy
        * Scipy
        * setuptools (for installation only)
        
        ## Main Features
        Currently, this is a sum up of what Pymicra does:
        
          - Reading, separating and understanding micrometeorological data in virtually any column-separated ASCII format (thanks to pandas).
          - Quality control methods (max and min values check, spikes, reverse-arrangement test and etc..
          - Rotation of coordinates (2D).
          - Detrending of data in the most common ways (block averages, moving averages and polynomial detrending).
          - Correction of sensor drift.
          - Automatic calculation of most auxiliary variables based on actual measurements (air density, dry air density, etc.).
          - Calculation of spectra and cross-spectra.
          - Calculation fluxes and characteristic scales.
          - WPL correction.
          - Provide all the common constants generally used in micrometeorology.
          - Plus all native features of Pandas (interpolation, resampling, grouping, statistical tests, slicing, handling of missing data and etc.)
        
        ## Installation
        To install Pymicra we recommend to install the `setuptools` package, which can be done with `sudo apt-get install python-setuptools, depending on your Linux distribution.
        
        Download the package an unpack in somewhere. Then open a terminal and move to the directory created, whose name should be `pymicra`. Then run `sudo python setup.py install`. This should be enough to install the package.
        
        To remove Pymicra, the easiest way is to use pip (`sudo apt-get install python-pip`) with the command `sudo pip uninstall pymicra`.
        
        ## Default notation
        To work Pymicra each column of data has to have its own name, so it is important that the names the user uses for columns match the ones that Pymicra uses (although a different-from-default notation can be passed to Pymicra). The next lines describe some general quantities, followed by the name that should be used inside straight brackets, followed by the units that compose it. The names provided are the default names and will be subjected to change by the user. You should  check the notation by using `print(pymicra.notation)`, but here's a quick introductory list:
        
         - mass concentration [conc] - (mass of substance)/(mass of air)
         - mass density [rho] - (mass of substance)/(volume of air)
         - molar density [mrho] - (moles of substance)/(volume of air)
         - mass mixing ratio [r] - (mass of substance)/(mass of dry air)
         - molar mixing ratio [mr] - (moles of substance)/(moles of dry air)
         - specific humidity [q] - (mass of h2o)/(mass of moist air)
        
        We also assume that the Reynolds decomposition of any variable "a" takes the form
            
            a = a_mean + a_fluctuation
        
        where the suffixes "\_mean" and "\_fluctuation", as well as other suffixes, are written within the variables' names as
         - mean [\_mean] - indicates that the mean was taken on the variable whose name precedes this
         - fluctuation ['] - indicates that this is the fluctuation of the variable: a' = a - a\_mean
         - star/asterisk [\_star] - indicates a turbulence scale of the variable: a\_star = mean(u'\*a')
        
        So that, in the Pymicra standard notation, the Reynolds decomposition is written as
        
            a = a_mean + a'
        
        The standard notation for common meteorological variables is 
         - thermodynamic temperature: [theta] 
         - virtual temperature: [theta\_v]
         - pressure: [p]
        
        The standard notation for micrometeorological variables currently is
         - Monin-Obukhov similarity variable: [zeta]
         - Monin-Obukhov length: [Lm]
         - momentum flux: [tau]
         - sensible heat flux: [H]
         - virtual sensible heat flux: [Hv]
         - water vapor flux: [E]
         - latent heat flux: [LE]
         - solute s flux: [F\_s]
        
        Some examples of names of variables following the standard notation are (description - [variable name in Pymicra]):
         - u fluctuations: [u']
         - turbulence scale for virtual temperature: [theta\_v\_star]
         - fluctuations of water density on air: [rho\_h2o']
         - mean mixing ratio for carbon dioxide: [r\_co2\_mean]
